## About me

**Hey there**, welcome to **my little corner** of the internet! Here, I **share** what I'm **learning** about **computers** and **engineering**, along with some **cool photos** I've taken.

It's not **fancy**, just me **jotting down** what I've **figured out**, like **solving tricky problems** or **working on fun projects**. And **hey**, I also **throw in** some of my **favorite snapshots** from my **photography hobby**!

If you're **into learning new stuff**, **tinkering with tech**, or just **enjoy good photos**, you're in the **right place**!
