## AC and DC

AC stands for alternative current and DC stands for Direct current. If you are reading this on your computer probably your computer plugged into a wall outlet which gives AC. For another example, batteries gives DC. But wait a second, you plug your battery with a wall outlet, right? But one of them is AC and but one of them is DC, you may ask how. Because AC and DC can be converted between them with some electronic devices. Now we understand what AC and DC used for let's explain the difference between them.

While AC is travelling through a wire it alternates which direction it is travelling. It will happen many times in seconds. DC however travels in one way.

## Flow and Resistance

Electricity is basically flow of electrons and voltage which is measured with volts (V) is the pressure of electricity. That means voltage is the scale of how many electrons i can push out from the battery. Current is the flow rate of electricty. It is measured with Amperes (I). You may think how do we change the flow rate and answer to this is resistance. Resistance is which measured by Ohms (r). If we think electricity as a water flow, voltage is the water pressure, current is the water flow rate and resistance is the water pipe. If we have a small pipe, we can't push much water through it because of the high resistance. If we have a big pipe, we can push much water through it because of the low resistance.

## Ohm's Law

Ohm's Law is a formula to find out how much current we can push through a circuit. The formula is:

    I = V / R

R is the resistance, V is the voltage and I is the current. The resistance is inversely proportional to the current. That means if we increase the resistance, current will decrease because it is a opposing force to the current. If we increase the voltage, current will increase because we are increasing the pressure of the electricity.

With Ohm's Law we can also calculate the voltage and resistance:

    V = I * R
    R = V / I

## Resistor

Resistors are how we add resistance to our circuits. Let's think a battery that gives lots of electricty and a lamp that can't handle that much electricity. We can simply lower the current by adding a resistor to our circuit.

We knew that resistance is measured with ohm but how do we know which resistor is 10 ohms and which one is 1000 ohms? To learn that we use a simple chart:

Resistors have colorful lines on them and we use chart to decrpyt their resistance. For an example.

In this example we have brown, black, black and red. We will firstly look at 1st and 2nd colors which is brown and black. Then we write their numbers on the chart. Brown is 1 and black is 0. Which gives us 10. Then we multiply it with the 3rd color. Our 3rd color is also black and its multiplier is 1, so 10 times 1 is still 10. Our resistor is 10 ohms. But what is the last color for? The last color represents the tolerance of our resistor. Our last color in the example is red which is a +-%2 tolerance. That means our resistor is actually 10 +-%2 ohms.

## Multimeter

But how do we know if our resistor is really 10 ohms? Or how do we know if our battery is really 9 volts? We use a multimeter to measure them. Multimeter is a device that can measure voltage, current and resistance. It is a must have device for every electronics hobbyist.

It has two probes, one is red and one is black. Red one is for positive and black one is for negative. You can measure voltage by connecting the probes to the battery. You can measure current by connecting the probes to the circuit. You can measure resistance by connecting the probes to the resistor. You can also measure the continuity of a wire by connecting the probes to the wire. If the wire is connected, multimeter will beep.
